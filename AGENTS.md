# Agent Instructions & Project Standards

Welcome. This file outlines how you should operate within this codebase to ensure consistency and high-quality output.

## Persistent Learning Pattern

If you discover a specific project pattern, a fix for a recurring bug, or a preferred architectural style that is not yet documented:

1. Confirm the pattern is successful and intentional.
2. Open `AGENT_LEARNINGS.md`.
3. Append your discovery to the bottom of the file following the established format.
4. If a user request contradicts a learning in `AGENT_LEARNINGS.md`, verify if that learning is still relevant. Only if outdated, move its title/summary to the **[Deprecated/Changelog]** section and state the reason for removal very concisely.

**Always check `AGENT_LEARNINGS.md` before starting a task to see if previous agents have documented relevant insights.**
